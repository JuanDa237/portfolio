		"2": "I've built some personal projects and a couple of websites, almost all of them are made with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) because it is my favorite, in the same way I'm always open to trying new technologies",
		"3": "I am a very self-taught person and my hobbies are swimming, cycling and play videogames"
